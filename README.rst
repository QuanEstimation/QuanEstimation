QuanEstimation
==============

|Dev|

QuanEstimation is a Python-Julia based open-source toolkit for quantum
parameter estimation, which consist in the calculation of the quantum
metrological tools and quantum resources, and the optimizations with
respect to the probe states, the controls or the measurements, as well
as comprehensive optimizations in quantum metrology. Futhermore,
QuanEstimation can generate not only optimal quantum parameter
estimation schemes, but also adaptive measurement schemes.
